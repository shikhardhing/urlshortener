# urlshortener
Add the URL to be shortened after http://urlshortene.herokuapp.com/new/ to get a number for shortened URL. Now append that number at the end of http://urlshortene.herokuapp.com/ to get redirected to original URL. For eg. go to http://urlshortene.herokuapp.com/new/http://example.com which will give a number like 9. Now go to http://urlshortene.herokuapp.com/9
